# Privacy Policy for WebDAV Image Saver

## Overview
WebDAV Image Saver is a browser extension that allows users to save web images directly to their personal WebDAV servers. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect
- **Server Configuration Data**: WebDAV server URLs, usernames, passwords, and folder preferences you configure
- **Local Usage Data**: Image URLs and page URLs when you use the save function (processed locally only)

### What We DON'T Collect
- We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal browsing data to any external servers
- We do NOT track your web browsing activities
- We do NOT collect analytics or usage statistics
- We do NOT sell or share any user data with third parties

### Data Storage
- All server configurations are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API
- Your WebDAV credentials are encrypted and stored locally on your device only
- No data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services

### Data Processing
- Image uploads are sent directly from your browser to YOUR configured WebDAV server
- We act only as a conduit - no image data passes through our systems
- All processing happens locally in your browser

## Permissions Explanation

### Required Permissions
